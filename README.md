Spotify Top Songs

**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**  <br>
The "Spotify Top Songs" repository contains a comprehensive songs analysis project developed using Power BI. The project aimed to analyze songs data from multiple sources and present insights through intuitive visualizations and interactive dashboards.

**OBJECTIVE:**  <br>
Evaluate the performance of Spotify top songs in terms of key performance indicators (KPIs). Identify trends, patterns and anomalies in the company's performance data over time. Generate actionable insights to inform data-driven decision-making. Enhance data transparency and accessibiity for Spotify music lovers.

**DATA EXTRACTION:**  <br>
Scripts or workflows utilized to retrieve and preprocess data from the Spotify API.

**DATA CLEANSING:**  <br> 
The column distribution, column profile and column quality was elucidated from the view ribbon of the power query editor. This was done to ascertain and check for the possibility of errors, null values, empty spaces, data uniqueness and distinctiveness, outliers, and inconsistencies.

**DATA TRANSFORMATION**  <br>
Transformation was done on the already cleansed data. The data had a lot of issues and required thorough cleansing, formatting, styling and re-organisation. This was done with a very high level of professionalism in order to maintain the integrity and originality of the data. The Transformed Data was then saved and made ready for the data modelling.

**DATA MODELING:**  <br> 
Designed a robust data model, incorporating various tables, relationships, and calculated columns for analysis. Power BI's data modeling capabilities were used to create relationships between different datasets. Data hierachy and date table creation using DAX was done,enabling a holistic view of Spotify songs performance.

**VISUALIZATION AND ANALYSIS:**  <br> 
Created interactive visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and geographical maps, to represent key performance, trends, and regional comparisons. These visuals allowed for easy interpretation of performance trends. The core focus of the project was on analyzing performance data over time. This involved creating time-based visualizations to track changes, seasonality, and growth in various KPIs. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were analyzed over time to access the company's overall performance.

**DASHBOARD CREATION:**  <br> 
Constructed a user-friendly dashboard presenting KPIs, music trends, and performance metrics.
Filtering and Slicing: Implemented dynamic filtering and slicing options for users to drill down into specific data points. This dashboard was developed to present the insights in an intuitive and interactive manner thereby enabling users to gain a deep understanding of the company's performance.
